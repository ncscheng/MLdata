This repository contains the projects completed by me during the Fall 2020 offering PHYSICS 288: Bayesian Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Physical Sciences at UC Berkeley. The course was designed and taught by Uros Seljak, with assistance from Biwei Dai and Byeonghee Yu.

The projects involve applying machine learning and data science techniques to real datasets, usually observational data associated with astronomy and/or cosmology. The background information in each notebook file was written by the course staff. All code was written by me. The notebooks have been edited for aesthetic and readability purposes; the original files are available on request.
